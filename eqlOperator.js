//Stating the difference b/w double and triple equal operator:

var num1 = 3;
var num2 = "3";
//So here it is printing true because value is same, it doesn't care about the datatypes:
console.log(num1 == num2);

//Now triple eqaul operator is stating the big difference while considering it as a datatype:

console.log(num1 === num2);
